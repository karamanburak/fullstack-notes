                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    HTML is the foundational building block of web pages, defining their
                    structure and content. My HTML courses cover everything from basic
                    tags to complex structures, emphasizing the latest features of
                    HTML5. Students learn to create accessible, standard-compliant web
                    pages that are also SEO-friendly. The training is designed for
                    learners at all levels, aiming to thoroughly grasp the fundamentals
                    of web development.

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    SS is a crucial tool for styling and enhancing the aesthetics and
                    user experience of web pages. In my courses, students explore
                    everything from CSS selectors to advanced animations, layout
                    techniques, and responsive design principles. The focus is on modern
                    layout systems like Flexbox and Grid, equipping students to create
                    clean, effective, and maintainable style sheets. These courses blend
                    both theoretical and practical aspects of CSS.

                <h3>REACT</h3>
                <p>
                    React, a popular JavaScript library for user interface development,
                    is a key focus of my training program. Starting from the basics, the
                    courses cover state management, life cycle methods, and creating
                    reusable components. I emphasize modern features like React Hooks
                    and the Context API, preparing students to develop interactive and
                    contemporary web applications. The training is aimed at equipping
                    developers with up-to-date React development skills.

                <p>
                    Node.js enables server-side JavaScript execution and is a powerful
                    platform for web server development. My training spans Node.js's
                    fundamentals to RESTful API development and database integration.
                    Students delve into advanced topics like asynchronous programming
                    and performance optimization. The practical, real-world examples in
                    the course aim to empower students to build robust, scalable

                <p>
                    SASS, a preprocessor language, enhances the dynamism and modularity
                    of CSS. My courses cover SASS from its basics to advanced concepts,
                    teaching cleaner, sustainable, and manageable style sheet creation.
                    We focus on the efficiency of SASS in reducing code redundancy and
                    enhancing project productivity. SASS is presented as a vital skill
                    in modern web design, integral to creating sophisticated styles..

                    Bootstrap is a preferred front-end framework for rapid and effective
                    web page design. My training comprehensively covers Bootstrap's grid
                    system, components, and helper classes. Learners understand how to
